TODO:  put some Terraform here that spins up one Linux box, and one Windows box, that I can use as "target nodes" / "managed nodes" _(within which I will check the OS version number, etc.)_.  No need to spin up one to serve as a "control node;" I'll just use the version of the Ansible Core CLI built into CI/CD pipeline runtime itself as a "control node."
